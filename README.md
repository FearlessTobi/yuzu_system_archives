System Files Generator for yuzu
==============

yuzu is an experimental open-source Nintendo Switch emulator/debugger written in C++. Running certain games requires some system archives.
Since the ones from the Switch are copyrighted this creates custom system archives.

Currently only the general shared font archive is supported.

FontStandard, FontKorean & FontChineseSimplified are using Open Sans Regular.  
FontChineseTraditional is using Open Sans Light.  
FontNintendoExtended is using Roboto Medium.  
FontExtendedChineseSimplified is using Source Sans Pro Regular.
